🏙️ Urban Micro-Climate Predictor (UHI)
Precision Machine Learning for Sustainable Urban Planning
!

📌 Project Overview
As cities grow, the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect becomes a critical climate challenge. This project provides a hyper-local Machine Learning solution to predict temperature variances at the street level.

Unlike general weather apps, this model uses urban morphology—building density, green cover, and proximity to water—to predict exactly how much hotter a specific city block will be compared to the regional average.

🚀 Unique Features
Hyper-Local Prediction: Street-level resolution instead of city-wide averages.

Actionable Insights: Helps urban planners decide exactly where to plant trees or install reflective surfaces to reduce heat.

Custom Synthetic Dataset: Uses a physically-informed synthetic dataset (1,000+ points) designed to mimic real-world urban thermal behavior.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

ML Framework: XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Deployment: Flask (Web Framework)

Serialization: Joblib (Pickle format)

📊 The Data
The dataset (urban_heat_data.csv) includes the following features:

Building Density: Ratio of concrete/built area.

Green Space Ratio: Percentage of vegetation/parks.

Traffic Volume Score: Heat generated by vehicle emissions.

Distance to Water: Cooling effect from lakes/rivers.

Avg Regional Temp: Baseline ambient temperature.

Target Variable: micro_temp_increase (Celsius variance).
